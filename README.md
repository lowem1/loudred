# Soundpoof! Consistency for Denoising AutoEncoders

![](docs/Loudred.jpeg?raw=true "Title")

Loudred is a data augmentation tool built to address creating generative noise samples for electronically translated documents(i.e.: Textract action engines and translation software). Our goal is to create a centralized effort around creating reusable noise generation schemes for establishing more consistent fine-tuned language model applications on smaller sets of unlabled text.

## Core Concepts
Common errors for these systems range from line and word segmentation to probablistic character entry errors. Loudred aims to generate noise mappings for training denoising AutoEncoders to promote more robust and reslient large language model applications.
